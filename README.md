# js-go
Java Script and Golang micro services

The results.html is a basic front end to seach for all data, individual ID, add a new ID or delete an ID.
This project is to showcase the caliber of Golang as microservices and only a demo lab excercise.

Start the ./secmain (or run the command "go run secmain.go" with golang 1.12 installed on your machine) and then run the results.html in your Chrome 42+ oe IE11+.
